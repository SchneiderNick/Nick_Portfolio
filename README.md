# Nick_Portfolio
A public repository of examples of scripts / automations written exclusively by Nicholas Schneider
*Disclaimer:
Any identifying data from any professional tenant has been removed. These scripts will not run as is. They are not meant to be used, but to just show the progression of script writing over my professional career (2018 - Present). Some scripts are rough, and some may not make sense as to what they do due to the scrubbing, but I can talk about each one and its purpose. 
This set of scripts were designed / Implemented / Maintained by Nicholas Schneider, independant of any "Software Engineering" team, and was used to simply create efficient workflows, and reduce manual labor.
